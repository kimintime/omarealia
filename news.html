				<h2>Gardening Days Coming Soon!</h2>
					<p>Springtime is in the air, and with the coming thaw comes green grass, colorful flowers, leaves on the trees, and time to get back to the nature. Did you know that as a shareholder, that you get to participate in the annual Gardening Days? Come join your fellow neighbors and help beautify our outdoor areas with your own personal touch! Signup sheets can be found in the entrance corridor, or signup at omarealia-&gt;services.</p>

				<h3>Meet the Neighbors: Maria Rose</h3>
					<p>In the last newsletter, we asked if you or one of your Realia neighbors happened to be a green thumb, and we got lots of interesting submissions, but there’s one in particular who has some gardening tips for you all this Spring. Meet Maria Rose. </p>
					<p>Maria Rose is well familiar to her fellow neighbors. Recently retired from her own flower shop, now run by her daughter, she spends her days with her husband and two dogs, still growing flowers for the shop that used to be hers. We asked Maria some tips for those new to gardening, and this is what she had to say.</p>
					<p><em>Q: Should people be shy about joining in the gardening days if they have no previous experience?</em></p>
					<p>A: Heaven’s no! After all, there’s no way to know if you like something until you try it. I would invite those more experienced among us to welcome people new to gardening, and to be clear and encouraging in their discussions. And for those looking to get a little practice, there’s no better way, especially if you didn’t have to buy the supplies yourself.</p>
					<p>The interview goes on from here, and we can all imagine the wonderful tips and tricks from Maria Rose. There would be all sorts of advice for current and future green-thumb apartment dwellers as for how to get back to nature.</p>

				<h2>Energy-saving tips</h2>
					<p>This month’s energy-saving tips have to do with led light bulbs. LED light bulbs use approximately 85% less energy than incandescent light bulbs and 40% less energy than fluorescent lights, making them a fundamental feature of energy efficient apartments. Talk to your landlord about swapping out your apartment’s current bulbs for LEDS, citing that LED light bulbs cost less than half that of incandescent bulbs when run five hours a day for two years. If they won’t make the investment, you can either swap them in yourself (if you’re planning to stay for a couple more years) or you can just use LEDs in your own fixtures, like floor and table lamps.</p>

				<h3>Topics for discussion:</h3>
					<p>May is just around the corner, and it will soon be time to welcome new graduates taking their first steps in life. Tune-in for May’s newsletter, where we offer advice to students entering the rental market for the first time. </p>
					<p>Do you know a future graduate taking on all the stresses of taking those next steps, and who’d like to participate? Contact us and let us know!</p>
					<p>Also with May, comes Vappu, and the controversial parties that comes with it. Where do you stand as a shareholder? Is Vappu a time-honored tradition, or a source of frustration in the form of endless noise and property damage? We’d like to hold a positive discussion of advice for how to celebrate without annoying everyone around you.</p>
